==10953== More than 10000000 total errors detected.  I'm not reporting any more.
==10953== Final error counts will be inaccurate.  Go fix your program!
==10953== Rerun with --error-limit=no to disable this cutoff.  Note
==10953== that errors may occur in your program without prior warning from
==10953== Valgrind, because errors are no longer being displayed.
==10953== 

valgrind: m_mallocfree.c:280 (mk_plain_bszB): Assertion 'bszB != 0' failed.
valgrind: This is probably caused by your program erroneously writing past the
end of a heap block and corrupting heap metadata.  If you fix any
invalid writes reported by Memcheck, this assertion failure will
probably go away.  Please try that before reporting this as a bug.

Note: see also the FAQ in the source distribution.
It contains workarounds to several common problems.
In particular, if Valgrind aborted or crashed after
identifying problems in your program, there's a good chance
that fixing those problems will prevent Valgrind aborting or
crashing, especially if it happened in m_mallocfree.c.

If that doesn't help, please report this bug to: www.valgrind.org

In the bug report, send all the above text, the valgrind
version, and what OS and version you are using.  Thanks.
